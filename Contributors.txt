
Contributors of the DWS-Project
===============================

The DWS Project is released under the Mozilla Public License v1.1

DelphiWebScript was created by Matthias Ackermann. 
But there are many people that contributed to the DWS project.

After a lull of several years, in which support went "dormant",
the codebase underwent multiple changes and compatibility upgrades 
under copyright of Creative IT (http://creative-it.net). 
Since the original websites went offline, the result was re-released under
the DWS "Revival" project, which is nowadays maintained by Eric Grange 
(http://delphitools.info).
What you see here was historically under the DWS2 name, though as DWS1 has
been deprecated completely, and DWS2 itself went dormant for a long time, 
the rerelease went back to the simpler "DWS" name.

The most current source code is currently hosted at google code in 
the dwscript project (http://code.google.com/p/dwscript/).
